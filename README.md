# pitchaverage

A [band I play in](https://cusptunes.bandcamp.com/album/you-can-do-it-all) had our recent release [reviewed by Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cusp-you-can-do-it-all/).<br>
Out of curiosity, I wrote this script that scrapes all the reviews from the Pitchfork API and spits out the average rating they've given albums over the years.
